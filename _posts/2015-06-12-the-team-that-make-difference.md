Today I'm leaving Plataformatec. It was 4 years working here and we acomplished a lot. I fell so
fortunate to had the oportunity to work on this team. Everyone were so smart and helpful,
that working there felt like a privilege. The projects that we worked were challenging and I felt that
I was making difference with my work.

And that summarize very well my feeling about working there, I feel that we were making difference.
Not just for our clients, but also to our coworker and our friends and relatives. And entire community
also benefited with our work since we contributed a lot to the open source community.

Here I had the oportunity to experiment and create. I had the chance to contribute back to the community
even through our projects but also through Rails. Plataformatec was helping the Rails Core Team since
the company began. José had a huge role on the Rails 3 release and Carlos and I carried his torch in the
Rails 4 release and since then I'm being the release manager and welcoming new contributors.

Leaving this company is being harder than leaving my parents to move to São Paulo. I had so many good
friends here, they are part of my family. I'll miss a lot participate of the day-by-day and not seeing
them eveyday. I'll miss the everyday jokes and the lunchs. The office and the people. I'll miss so much.

I'm leaving it not because I found something better, or because we don't share the same goals, but
because I want something difference. I can say that hardly I'll find some place better, or more
welcoming that what I have here. I think that the place I'm going have a lot of potential to be the
same and this is enough, because here I had so much.

I'm really happy to have worked at Plataformatec, and want to thank everyone that worked with me.
Thank you for the partners, that trusted me when nobody knews my potential, for giving me support and
for embracing my crazy ideas. For my heroes (idols and references) José, Carlos, George, Hugo, João,
Gustavo, Lucas, Rondy, Erich, Kassio and Ulisses for making my job chalenging, easy, funny and joyful.
For my shields Junior, Ozaki, Carol, Wesley and Nathalia for letting me free to work on the most important
things. And for all my coworkers for make me fell in home and helping me to do the best work I can make
everyday.

Thank you so much Plataformatec, for making difference in my life. Your culture will live with me
forever.
